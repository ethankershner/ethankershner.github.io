# **About Me**

I am a Data Analyst and Scientist currently living in Doylestown, PA. I have developed on my training in data analysis in the field of Neuroscience to succesfully apply data science techniques to generate key insights and solve problems in business. Through the joint use of statistical analysis and data analysis packages I have succesfully informed and optimized business decision-making processes. In addition, in order to improve my skills and solve interesting problems, I have completed numerous personal projects which are presented here. Among my values as a data analyst are clear and accessible visualization and data comprehension, rigorous validation of statistical assumptions and the judicious application of regression and classifcation algorithms when justified.
